<b>Fig. 2. and Fig. S1.</b> Mapping of the flavoproteome on the models before (grey, Recon 2.2) and after curation (black, Recon 2.2_FAD or Recon 2.2_flavo).

<b>Fig. 3. and Fig. S2.</b> New models can correctly simulate the physiology of MADD.

<b>Fig. 4.and Fig. S4.</b> Coupling of FAD-related reactions to FAD-biosynthesis enabled the new model to respond to low cofactor availability.

<b>Fig. 5.</b> Changes in the ATP yield from different carbon sources in flavoprotein-related diseases predict metabolic adaptations in energy metabolism.

<b>Table. 2, Table. S3, and Fig. S3</b> Metabolic biomarkers for flavoprotein-related diseases.

<b>Fig S5.</b> Recon 3D can correctly simulate the physiology of MADD after our FAD fix was applied.
